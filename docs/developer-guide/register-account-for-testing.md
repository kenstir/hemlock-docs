# How to Register an Account for Testing

Because this app requires an account, the app stores require you to register an account
for testing.

## Android

The Play Store calls this "App access".

* Open the [Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
* Select the app
* Choose `Monitor and improve` then `App content`
* Under the `Actioned` tab is `App access`
